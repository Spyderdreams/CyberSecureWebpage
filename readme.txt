Assignment 12.1: Final Project - HTML & CSS

Description:
This website project for CyberSecure introduces users to basic cybersecurity practices. The site is built with semantic HTML5 and styled using a custom external CSS stylesheet (`style.css`).

The HTML documents (`index.html`, `guides.html`, `resources.html`, `about.html`) clearly define the page structure with sections such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to provide easy navigation and a user-friendly interface.

The CSS styling in `style.css` creates a modern, responsive, dark-themed layout. It uses CSS Grid and Flexbox for content alignment and media queries to ensure the design adapts to different screen sizes, providing a professional and clear user experience.

Files included:
- index.html
- guides.html
- resources.html
- about.html
- style.css
